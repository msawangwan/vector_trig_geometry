# Vectors, Trig and Geometry

## I Love MATH!!!

* * *

- Everything in this project is *WIP* and for *prototyping* purposes
- Some code isn't optimized
- Some scripts are _scratch_ scripts for collecting my notes on various subjects
- Originally, this project was just to practice math related functionality
- Feel free to copy my code, attribution would be nice but...no one's gonna' hold you to it
